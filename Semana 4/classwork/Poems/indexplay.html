		<p>His vision, from the constantly passing bars,<br>
		has grown so weary that it cannot hold<br>
		anything else. It seems to him there are<br>
		a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.<br>
		<br>
		As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,<br>
		the movement of his powerful soft strides<br>
		is like a ritual dance around a center<br>
		in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.<br>
		<br>
		Only at times, the curtain of the pupils<br>
		lifts, quietly--. An image enters in,<br>
		rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,<br>
		plunges into the heart and is gone.Â
