<div class="contenedor">

<p>His vision, from the constantly passing bars,<br>
has grown so weary that it cannot hold<br>
anything else. It seems to him there are<br>
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.<br>
<br>
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,<br>
the movement of his powerful soft strides<br>
is like a ritual dance around a center<br>
in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.<br>
<br>
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils<br>
lifts, quietly--. An image enters in,<br>
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,<br>
plunges into the heart and is gone.Â
